#Harry was studying a magic book that categorizes the magic spells into 3 categories - 
# Good , Worst and Bad. If any spell contains all the vowels in alphabetical order then that spell is categorized as Good. 
# If it contains the vowels in reverse alphabetical order , then that spell is categorized as Worst. 
# All the other spells that do not fall in any of the categories before are categorized as Bad
